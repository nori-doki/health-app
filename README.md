# 🥗 80to100 – Your Simple Path to Better Health

**80to100** is a health tracking mobile first SaaS built with **Vue 3**. It helps you stay consistent and improve over time by embracing the 80/20 rule: no need for perfection, just progress.

This project is a personal need of mine : logging daily scores for meals, snacks, steps & workouts in order to track my health efforts and make sure I stick to my diet 80% fo the time.
It is inspired by the famous 80-20 guideline of dieting that says "eat clean 80% fo the time" or "diet is 80% diet and 20% exercise".
